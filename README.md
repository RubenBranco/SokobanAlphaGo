# Sokoban AlphaGo Zero (WIP)

Sokoban Solver using DeepMinds AlphaGo Zero system, described by [Silver et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270), download deepmind unformatted upload available [here](https://deepmind.com/documents/119/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf).

Implementation based on [suragnair](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) implementation.

All board examples come from [abelmartin's website](http://www.abelmartin.com/rj/sokoban_colecciones.html).

This is a work in progress and more details about the implementation will be given and the README will be updated as the project moves forward. The objective is to understand how the process works and whether it will work for singleplayer games(aka puzzles).
